# SVG Logo Maker

## Description

My task for week 10 was to build a svg logo maker using the inquirer package. The user is prompted a set of questions in the command line. the user can choose up to 3 characters to have for the content, a shape for the content to be in, and what color you want it to be. after all that information has been acquired, your svg logo will show up in the dist folder and be available for use.
